# Trillo

Trillo is a site I developed in less than a day in order to master `CSS flexbox`.  
It includes CSS vars, CSS masks, an SVG stripe, and many techniques to create a beautiful flex layout.   
Moreover, the site contains some media queries that make it very responsive.

Enjoy navigating the code :octocat:
