# Trillo
<hr>

Trillo is a site I developed in less than a day in order to master `css flexbox`.  
It includes animations, css masks, svg stripe, and many techniques to  
create a beautiful layout using flexbox.   
Moreover, the side includes media queries to make it responsive.  

Enjoy navigating the code :octocat:
